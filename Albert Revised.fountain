Hello. _I'm.. I'm_ an eagle. Yes. I'm a bit of a _cyborg -- cyborg_ bird. My brain interfaces with a computer system that I built with _my two, my claws_, which you can't see right now cause _I.. I_ tuck them away when I'm in flight... There are also _some cameras.. some drones_ I also made to document my flight and.. adventures maybe.. eventually. But now I just want to answer questions. So I'm not speaking.. But my computer _brain translates for my bird(avian) brain_.. so it works. How did I do all this stuff? _I'm crazy smart. dexterity too. Claw dexterity. I'm not sure why I'm this smart_.... but I have some ideas. The leading theory is that.. well we know there was a big.. massive war with nuclear bombs over 2000 years ago. Really destroyed the planet, _do you understand_? There's still a blanket of radiation hovering.. Every piece of life is broken... Well.. I guess eagles have done pretty well.. recently. As I was saying, my theory is that a lineage of eagles experienced an incredibly long.. astronomically lucky sequence of mutations as a result of the radiation.. Other birds think maybe.. _yanno. It's God. Yanno_, something else made this happen. There's lots to _explain, and I will explain_ it... I know all about humans too. Maybe one day I'll take you to one of their villages.. show you _what they're.. what those_ things are up to. For now I just have to keep flying. I'll just keep explaining what I'm doing _I guess_. Cut to the aerial shot... _Look at me fly. I'm a gorgeous bird_... Over the ocean now... the most dangerous point in my journey.. Even though humans are basically helpless now, _I learned a lot from them. I know about their history, their technology, art, culture.. I_ think it's all very beautiful... SHIT CUT TO THE WIDE SHOT! FADE TO BLACK!
